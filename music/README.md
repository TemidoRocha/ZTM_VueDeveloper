## HTML and Static Assets

https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/html-and-static-assets.html

## state

State is just another way of saying data.
Data that is tracked while the appplication is active.
It's not just the data in a database, but the data used to keep track of what should be happening inside the applciation.

## plugins

Are a way to add global-level functionality to vue.
Can add global methods, properties, componenets, assets, directives, filters, transitions, etc.
Easy to use; Load a module and then tell Vue to use it.

They need to be registed before the mounting the instance.

## mapping State

getters are better for performing a calculation on/with a state property,
mapping teh state is better for retrieving a state property.
